Description
===========
Erwa is the implementation of the WAMP protocol in Erlang.
It supports the router and the peer role, so the client and
the server side.

Pull Requests, Bug Reports, Comments and any other kind of feedback is welcome.

Router
======
The router implementation in Erwa uses the great [ranch](https://github.com/extend/ranch)
and [cowboy](https://github.com/extend/cowboy) from [Lo√Øc Hoguin (essen)](https://github.com/essen)
to handle the incomming connections and the webserver part for the websockets.
Erwa has two modules to work either as a protocol for ranch on incomming TCP connections, or
as websocket handler with cowboy on incomming websocket connections.

All you need to do to get a simple WAMP router up and running is to add a dispatch rule to
ranch and/or cowboy:

A WAMP router on websockets:
* using erwa_in_handler as the websocket handler, by dispatching a certain path to conditions
* starting cowboy on a certain port (here 8080) and add the dispatch rule
```Erlang
%% a rule to dispatch incomming connections to any host with the path /wamp to the erwa_in_handler
Dispatch = cowboy_router:compile([ {'_', [ {"/wamp", erwa_in_handler, []}, ]} ]),
%% fire up cowboy with the dispatch rule for the wamp connection
{ok, _} = cowboy:start_http(http, 100, [{port, 8080}],[{env, [{dispatch, Dispatch}]}]),
```
In the examples directory you can find the simple_router which includes just the above
and starts a WAMP router, including a simple javascript client,
using [wampy.js](https://github.com/KSDaemon/wampy.js).

The other possibility is to start Erwa as a TCP router:
Erwa implements a protocol for ranch in the erwa_in_handler modules.
So starting and tcp router is done by starting ranch with
erwa_in_handler as the protocol:
```Erlang
%% start ranch with the wamp protocol by using erwa_in_handler on port 555
{ok,_} = ranch:start_listener(erwa_tcp, 5, ranch_tcp, [{port,5555}], erwa_in_handler, []),
```
This is also included in the simple_router example in the examples directory.

By default Erwa does not automatically create realms. This is activated by the boolean
*autocreate_realm* flag.
If you only want to support certain realm you need to start them by using erwa:start_realm/1,
which takes the name of the realm to start as argument.

Peer
====
Erwa implements the basic profile for all four roles of a peer, caller and callee as well as
publisher and subscriber.
The connection to the router can either be remote to another host/port or local to a router
running within the same VM.

The connections are implemented as gen_server and can be shared between different processes.
The Idea is to have just one connection to a router and share it with all needing processes.
*A lookup of connections to certain routers and realms is not yet implemented, yet under consideration*

To connect to a realm you need to follow a few simple steps:
```Erlang
%% first start a connection
{ok,Con} = erwa:start_client(),
%% then connect to either a local or remote router
%% local would be
{ok,SessionId,RouterDetails} = erwa:connect(Con,Realm),
%% the following is a remote router
{ok,SessionId,RouterDetails} = erwa:connect(Con,Host,Port,Realm,Encoding),


%% now the connection 'Con' is connected to the router and handles everything for you
%% sending an event to a certain topic is just as easy:
%% the two parameters Arguments and ArgumentsKW are optional.
ok = erwa:publish(Con,Options,EventTopicUrl,Arguments,ArgumentsKW),

%% invoking a remote procedure is easy, too:
%% as with publishing are the Arguments and the ArgumentsKW optional.
%% ResA and ResAKw may be undefined in case they did not include any data.
{ok,Details,ResA,ResAKw} = erwa:call(Con,Options,ProcedureUri,Arguments,ArgumentsKW),

%% for subscription to a topic or registering a function for remote calls
%% there exist two different ways:
%% one is to use a tuple of module, function and one argument that will be called by erwa.
%% this is the easiest way, yet has the drawback that you can only forward one argument
%% to your function and not return any state change or similar.
%% the following line will invoke Module:Function(Details,Arguments,ArgumentsKW,OneArgument)
%% on the occurance of an event.
{ok,SubscriptionId} = erwa:subscribe(Con,Options,EventUrl,{Module,Function,OneArgument}),

%% the same works for registering a remote procedure.
%% the function that will be called here is also:
%% Module:Function(Details,Arguments,ArgumentsKW,OneArgument)
{ok,RegistrationId} = erwa:register(Con,Options,ProcedureUri,{Module,Function,OneArgument}),


%% the other possibility is to subscribe or register without giving an mfa.
%% In this case the process will receive the
%% {erwa,{event,SubscriptionId,PublicationId,Details,Arguments,ArgumentsKw}}
%% message for an event and the
%% {erwa,{invocation,RequestId,RegistrationId,Details,Arguments,ArgumentsKw}}
%% message for an invocation.
%% you MUST reply to an invocation by using erwa:yield/3,erwa:yield/4 or erwa:yield/5.
%%
{ok,SubscriptionId} = erwa:subscribe(Con,Options,EventUri),
{ok,RegistrationId} = erwa:register(Con,Options,ProcedureUri),
```

The crossbar_client example includes registration and subscriptions using mfa.
Also have a look at the simple_client example for a client implementation using gen_server
and subscribe and register without mfa.

Examples
========

In the exampes directory you can find three different examples:
 * crossbar_client: This is the template used in crossbar to demonstrate the usage of an erlang client with crossbar.io.
 * simple_client: A simple client that shows how a client can be implemented using a gen_server.
 * simple_router: A very tiny example, showing how easy it is to fire up a WAMP router using Erwa.
