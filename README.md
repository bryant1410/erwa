Erwa
====
[![passing or failing?](https://travis-ci.org/bwegh/erwa.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bwegh/erwa/)


Erwa is an implementation of [WAMP (Web Application Messaging Protocol)](http://wamp.ws/spec/) router in Erlang.
The client/peer side has been moved to a seperate project called [Awre](https://github.com/bwegh/awre). Both use the library [Wamper](https://github.com/bwegh/wamper).

Description
===========
Erwa is the implementation of the WAMP protocol in Erlang.
It supports the router, so the server side.

Pull Requests, Bug Reports, Comments and any other kind of feedback is welcome.

Router
======
The router implementation in Erwa uses the great [ranch](https://github.com/extend/ranch)
and [cowboy](https://github.com/extend/cowboy) from [Lo√Øc Hoguin (essen)](https://github.com/essen)
to handle the incomming connections and the webserver part for the websockets.
Erwa has two modules to work either as a protocol for ranch on incomming TCP connections, or
as websocket handler with cowboy on incomming websocket connections.

All you need to do to get a simple WAMP router up and running is to add a dispatch rule to
ranch and/or cowboy:

A WAMP router on websockets:
* using erwa_in_handler as the websocket handler, by dispatching a certain path to conditions
* starting cowboy on a certain port (here 8080) and add the dispatch rule
```Erlang
%% a rule to dispatch incomming connections to any host with the path /wamp to the erwa_in_handler
Dispatch = cowboy_router:compile([ {'_', [ {"/wamp", erwa_in_handler, []}, ]} ]),
%% fire up cowboy with the dispatch rule for the wamp connection
{ok, _} = cowboy:start_http(http, 100, [{port, 8080}],[{env, [{dispatch, Dispatch}]}]),
```
In the examples directory you can find the simple_router which includes just the above
and starts a WAMP router, including a simple javascript client,
using [wampy.js](https://github.com/KSDaemon/wampy.js).

The other possibility is to start Erwa as a TCP router:
Erwa implements a protocol for ranch in the erwa_in_handler modules.
So starting and tcp router is done by starting ranch with
erwa_in_handler as the protocol:
```Erlang
%% start ranch with the wamp protocol by using erwa_in_handler on port 555
{ok,_} = ranch:start_listener(erwa_tcp, 5, ranch_tcp, [{port,5555}], erwa_in_handler, []),
```
This is also included in the simple_router example in the examples directory.

By default Erwa does not automatically create realms. This is activated by the boolean
*autocreate_realm* flag.
If you only want to support certain realm you need to start them by using erwa:start_realm/1,
which takes the name of the realm to start as argument.

Examples
========

In the exampes directory you can find a simple router example:
 * simple_router: A very tiny example, showing how easy it is to fire up a WAMP router using Erwa.
